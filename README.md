# 🥑 AvoTox - Codeology Fall 2024
- Sentiment analysis model that parses through and classifies sentences into different toxicity categories while detecting threats, racism, and the general severity of toxicity
- The first half of the project will focus on building and training the model using Kaggle databases. From there, we will transition into utilizing APIs to examine the toxicity of comments across different social media platforms, such as Reddit and Instagram

## 🗒️ Overview 
- Tech Areas: Data Preprocessing, Machine Learning, Deep Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Tools/Techs: Kaggle (Data Sets), API (For social media integration)
- Individual Project

# Setting Up Python 3.11.4 with VSCode
Step 1: Install Python 3.11.4
If Python 3.11.4 is not already installed on your system, follow the steps below:

Using pyenv
Run the following commands in your terminal:

pyenv install 3.11.4
pyenv global 3.11.4

Ensure pyenv is properly set up in your environment.


Using a Package Manager
On macOS (via Homebrew):

brew install python@3.11

On Linux (via apt or dnf):
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3.11

On Windows: Download and install Python 3.11.4 from the official Python website.

# Step 2: Add Python 3.11.3 to VSCode
Open VSCode and press Ctrl+Shift+P (or Cmd+Shift+P on macOS) to open the Command Palette.
Search for Python: Select Interpreter and select it.
In the interpreter selection menu, look for Python 3.11.4. If it does not appear:
Click Enter interpreter path... at the bottom.
Manually locate the Python 3.11.4 binary:
On macOS/Linux: /usr/local/bin/python3.11 or /opt/homebrew/bin/python3.11
On Windows: C:\Python311\python.exe (or the location where Python is installed).

# Step 3: Set Python 3.11.3 as the Default Interpreter
Once you select Python 3.11.3 as the interpreter, VSCode will use it for your current workspace.
To set it globally for all workspaces:
Go to File > Preferences > Settings (or Cmd+, on macOS).
Search for Python: Default Interpreter Path.
Set it to the path of Python 3.11.4, e.g., /usr/local/bin/python3.11.

# Step 4: Verify the Selected Interpreter
Open the integrated terminal in VSCode (`Ctrl+```) and run:
python --version
It should display:
Python 3.11.4
