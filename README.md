# 🥑 AvoTox - Codeology Fall 2024
- Sentiment analysis model that parses through and classifies sentences into different toxicity categories while detecting threats, racism, and the general severity of toxicity
- The first half of the project will focus on building and training the model using Kaggle databases. From there, we will transition into utilizing APIs to examine the toxicity of comments across different social media platforms, such as Reddit and Instagram

## 🗒️ Overview 
- Tech Areas: Data Preprocessing, Machine Learning, Deep Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Tools/Techs: Kaggle (Data Sets), API (For social media integration)
- Individual Project

Step 1: Install Python 3.11.3
If Python 3.11.3 is not already installed on your system:

Using pyenv:

Run the following commands in your terminal:
bash
Copy code
pyenv install 3.11.3
pyenv global 3.11.3
Ensure pyenv is properly set up in your environment.
Using a package manager:

On macOS (via Homebrew):

bash
Copy code
brew install python@3.11
On Linux (via apt or dnf):

bash
Copy code
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3.11
On Windows: Download and install Python 3.11.3 from the official website.

Step 2: Add Python 3.11.3 to VSCode
Open VSCode and press Ctrl+Shift+P (or Cmd+Shift+P on macOS) to open the Command Palette.
Search for Python: Select Interpreter and select it.
In the interpreter selection menu (like the screenshot you provided), look for Python 3.11.3.
If Python 3.11.3 does not appear in the list, click Enter interpreter path... at the bottom and manually locate the Python 3.11.3 binary:
On macOS/Linux: /usr/local/bin/python3.11 or /opt/homebrew/bin/python3.11
On Windows: C:\Python311\python.exe or wherever you installed it.
Step 3: Set Python 3.11.3 as the Default Interpreter
Once you select Python 3.11.3 as the interpreter, VSCode will use it for your current workspace.
If you'd like to set it globally for all workspaces:
Go to File > Preferences > Settings (or Cmd+, on macOS).
Search for Python: Default Interpreter Path.
Set it to the path of Python 3.11.3, e.g., /usr/local/bin/python3.11.
Step 4: Verify the Selected Interpreter
Open the integrated terminal in VSCode (`Ctrl+```) and run:
bash
Copy code
python --version
It should display Python 3.11.3.
